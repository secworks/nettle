(2013-12-12) Moving the chacha implementation to subdir and creating a
separate branch for the patch completion to integrate ChaCha into
nettle.


(2013-12-11) First version of the ChaCha stream cipher. The code is
complete. There is a test program that verifies that the cipger works
with 128 and 256 bit keys and 8, 12, 20 rounds.
